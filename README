Dunfell
=======

Dunfell provides a library for extracting events from GLib main contexts and
visualising them for the purposes of debugging and optimisation. It provides
graphical utilities for this purpose.

See the test programs in libdunfell/tests/ for simple examples of how to use
the code.

libdunfell’s API is currently unstable and is likely to change wildly.
